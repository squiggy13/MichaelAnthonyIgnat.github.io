										<h2>The History</h2>
									</header>

									<p>During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of delving into Michigan's rich history and
										shedding light on a forgotten aspect of the American Civil War.
										My master's thesis focused on the often-overlooked music of the era and its significance in
										understanding the civilian experience during the war. It was an honor to preserve and
										share the history of Michigan. By connecting communities with audible
										music examples, I aimed to expand the narrative beyond traditional
										interpretations and bring the history to life.</p>

									<blockquote>
										<i>“And another thing I want you to pay attention to – that is music.”</i>

									</blockquote>

									<p>My research centered around sheet music from 1860s Michigan, providing a unique lens through
										which I explored and interpreted the messages conveyed by the music of that time.
										I firmly believe that music offers a distinctive insight into the lives of Michiganders
										during the Civil War, particularly in how families on the home front engaged with music as a
										means of expression and connection.
									</p>
									<p>While military bands and traveling music groups produced music that reflected the war's
										social and political climate, the musical experiences of families in less-populated areas
										were less documented. Informal parlor music played a crucial role in fostering a sense of
										community and emotional support during the war. Although sheet music was widely accessible
										due to economic expansion and advancements in printing, the lack of audible examples has
										limited public engagement with these songs to those who can read sheet music.
									</p>
									<p>My lasting contribution lies in using music to fill gaps in historical narratives and
										provide a broader understanding of Michigan's Civil War experiences. Through this project,
										I aimed to engage audiences and enable them to connect with the cultural and social significance
										of the music from Michigan's past.

										<h2>What Did They Sing in Michigan?</h2>
									</header>


									<p>Recognizing this gap, I took it upon myself to bridge the divide and make 1860s Michigan
										music more accessible to the public. I curated an album of 10 songs titled
										<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeQL8F9-pqkIIG4miH5hlStavd4AdlZzP">
										<i>What Did They Sing in Michigan?</i></a> This collection of re-produced parlor songs provides a
										window into the attitudes and perspectives of middle-class Michiganders during the war.
										By connecting communities with audible examples of the music, I aimed to expand our
										understanding beyond films and re-enactments.

									<br>
									<p>To bring this project to life, I meticulously transcribed sheet music from the Burton
										Historical Collection in Detroit and various online sources. Using the program MuseScore,
										I digitally produced the piano parts of each song. Additionally, I enlisted the help of
										six volunteer singers, two of whom were from the Mount Pleasant community, to record the
										remaining parts. Although the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges, we managed to create a
										socially distanced recording environment in the CMU Music Building. Throughout the process,
										I emphasized the old-fashioned, operatic style to maintain authenticity.
